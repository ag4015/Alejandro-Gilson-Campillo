				<h2>About me</h2>
				<p>I'm Alejandro Gilson Campillo. I designed this site so you can get to know me on a personal level. My career, my portfolio, my hobbies and much more.</p>
				<p>I am a student at Imperial College London (ICL) studying an MEng in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I was born in Madrid but graduated from secondary school in Barcelona.
				I am specialized in the development of hardware and software for demanding problems that require efficient solutions. I have a broad experience
				in the area of analog and digital systems, signal processing, machine learning and general purpose software. </p>
				<p>If, after all, I happen to have caught your interest, don't hesitate to contact me for any opportunities, ideas or just a coffee and a chat. For more details, my CV is available for download.</p>

				<div class="gloveText">
					<p>In my second year as a student I lead a group of engineering students in the development of an articulated exoskeleton to aid people with hand disabilities. It involved the use of sensors, motors and data processing. The purpose of the device was to provide strength to the patient whenever he had an intent of moving his hand. Due to the achievements of this project we were awarded a second price for best project in our year.</p>
					<p>Whenever the user wishes to move a finger downwards, the touch sensor detects it and the motors pull the fingers down. The finger would then go up with the use of elastic bands.</p>

				In my third year as a student I developed a machine learning algorithm that could grade from 1 to 10 the quality of "vinho verde" wine from the north of Portugal. I was provided with a large data set of red and white wines that had been graded by the average of three oenologists and my task was to minimize the error. Several properties of the wine were available such as acidity and alcohol percentage.</p>

				<p>After attempting several algorithms such as linear regression, support vector machines and neural networks, the method that introduced the least mean squared error happened to be that of the neural network. For further information, please contact me. </p>

				<p>One of the projects I have been involved in is the development of an intelligent DSP algorithm that reduces the background noise behind speech signals while maintaining the quality of the message. This algorithm is based on the assumption that the speaker will pause talking during a 10 second time period.</p>
				<p>A Texas Instrument DSP board was programmed in C to compute this algorithm. The program looked for the frequency components with the least magnitude for the last 10 seconds. It then substracted these components from the input signal. Further enhancements were implemented to increase the quality of the signal. For further information, please contact me. Here is a sample for you to listen.</p>

					<p>As an intern at Airbus I developed an electromagnetic susceptibility test software for Airbus. Susceptibility tests measure the vulnerability of the device to electro-magnetic emissions.</p>
					<p>The software controlled a wide range of equipment such as antennas, signal generators, amplifiers and field probes. It generated the desired electric field for a specific frequency range in an anechoic chamber and returned measured data. I also developed a Win32 user interface to make the program easier to use.</p>

					This was my first year project as a student. This device uses an infrared
					emitter and two infrared sensors to detect a painted line on the ground.
					 The difference in reflection between the background color and the color
					 of the line determines the position of the device. Finally, a microprocessor
					uses this information to control the DC motors and follow the line.

					<p>As a third year student I took part in the development of an automated material testing for FACT. This startup creates novel materials that are used in many areas such as the aerospace industry. These materials require many tests for the to be commercially available.</p>
					<p>One of the tests done is the double cantilever test, where the propagation of a crack is monitored while a material is being pulled appart. This task was done by a human and was, therefore, laborious and prone to error. Our system automated this task with the use of computer vision. For more information, don't hesitate to contact me.</p>
